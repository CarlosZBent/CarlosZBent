Hi. Mi name is **Carlos Z. Bent** and I'm from **Cuba**.
I'm a self taught **Full Stack Web Developer** and **Python** programmer. I also write and I study law. 
I mainly work with Vue.js, jQuery and Django as frameworks/libraries. Also made minor projects with PyTelegramBot and Tkinter.
For CSS I actually like vanilla, but I use Bootstrap for a lot of little things.

I'm currently working on my own projects. Anything that comes to mind I execute. Meanwhile I'm preparing for some major projects I have in mind for whenever I have time.

I love learning new languages. Currently speak Spanish, English, and a bit of German. Right now learning Russian.
I play videogames a lot, and want to build some at some point, I read, and consume a lot of sports.

You can hit me up for anything you need on [Telegram](https://t.me/CarlosZBent) or [Showwcase](https://showwcase.com/carloszbent). 
I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CarlosZBent)
