# About me 

Hi. Mi name is **Carlos Z. Bent** and I'm from **Cuba**.

I'm a self taught **Web Developer** and **Python** programmer. I also write and I study law. 

# Main technologies I work with

* I mainly work with **React.js** and **Django** as frameworks/libraries for the web. 
* I also work with **[python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot)** 
* and **Tkinter**.
* For CSS I actually like vanilla, but I use Bootstrap when needed.

# Getting more personal

I love learning new languages. Currently speak Spanish, English, and a bit of German. Right now learning Russian.
I play videogames a lot, and want to build some at some point, I read, and consume a lot of sports.
